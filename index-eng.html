                Non-profit shelter where a team of 40 volunteers work to give these
                dogs a second chance, since they deserve to be loved and have a home where they can be happy :)

                            Dafne is super affectionate and does not plan to miss the opportunity to receive pampering. He is super sociable with other wolves and has been waiting for a long time to find the family that will give him a second chance. Like many others, these types of dogs are bred for hunting and then abandoned, but this case is surprising for its ability to live in a small house and be a great companion dog!

                            This little wolf is really beautiful. We believe it is from a perigri breeder due to its beauty and tongue marking. He is very sociable with other human beings. He and Neska are currently dating. Desider suffers from canine leukemia and needs a family to care for him.

                            old-fashioned sheepdog functions. She was abandoned with her newborn puppies, which were already
